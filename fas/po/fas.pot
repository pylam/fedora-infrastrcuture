"FAS is designed around an open architecture.  Unlike the traditional "
"account systems where a single admin or group of admins decide who gets "
"to be in what group, FAS is completely designed to be self operating per "
"team.  Every group is given at least one administrator who can then "
"approve other people in the group.  Also, unlike traditional account "
"systems.  FAS allows people to apply for the groups they want to be in.  "
"This paridigm is interesting as it allows anyone to find out who is in "
"what groups and contact them.  This openness is brought over from the "
"same philosophies that make Open Source popular."

"People shouldn't assume that by applying for a group that they're then in"
" that group.  Consider it like applying for another job.  It often takes "
"time.  For best odds of success, learn about the group you're applying "
"for and get to know someone in the group.  Find someone with sponsor or "
"admin access and ask them if they'd have time to mentor you.  Plan on "
"spending at least a few days learning about the group, doing a mundain "
"task, participating on the mailing list.  Sometimes this process can take"
" weeks depending on the group.  It's best to know you will get sponsored "
"before you apply."

"Once you're in the group, you're in the group.  Sponsorship and "
"Administrators typically have special access in the group in questions.  "
"Some groups consider sponsorship level to be of a higher involvement, "
"partial ownership of the group for example.  But as far as the account "
"system goes the disctinction is easy.  Sponsors can approve new users and"
" make people into sponsors.  They cannot, however, downgrade or remove "
"other sponsors.  They also cannot change administrators in any way.  "
"Administrators can do anything to anyone in the group."
