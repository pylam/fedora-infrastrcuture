To build the gpxe images, first download the source tarball from cvs.  Then:

cd src
cp /path/to/bfo/*gpxe ./
sudo ln -s /usr/share/syslinux /usr/lib/syslinux
make EMBEDDED_IMAGE=dhcp.gpxe,static.gpxe bin/gpxe.iso


Note: Building new pxe images should really only be used to fix bugs in gpxe.
BFO menus and things are downloaded with every boot so new pxe images don't
need to be built for most changes.
